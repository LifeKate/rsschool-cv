        <h3>Briefly About Myself</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>Purpose: to do as much good as possible in life. Learn and develop.</li>
            <li>Priorities: to grow and develop. Learn new technologies.</li>
        </ul>>
            <p>I grew up in the small town of Svetlogorsk, and having entered the university, there was a clear understanding that I want to stay in Minsk. Knowledge is power. It's never too late to learn. The knowledge gained at the university was not enough, I wanted more. This is where the prospect of discovering a new sphere of IT life opened up. At first it seemed like some kind of scary symbols and it seemed that it was impossible to master. But with time and knowledge, you understand what all these symbols mean, you discover a new language. You understand that you can create something with your own hands, and you enjoy each new function.This is how I came from a chemist-technologist to programming/</p>
